### What is live coding?

  _**“Live Coding is a new direction in electronic music and video, and is getting somewhere interesting. Live Coders exposes and rewire the innards of software while it generates improvised music.”**_ \- toplap.org

*   Interactive programming as an audio and/or visual art performance
*   Using code to describe rules for an art piece
*   Live notation/composition as performance
*   Code can be changed and re-executed in real-time, while the program is running (compose music while performing)
*   Takes computer language into a social environment, thus making coding to a social activity

### Why using code?


*   Classical music with notation on sheets is already a code to write musical pieces
*   Pitch, duration, loudness in sheet music is a code, that can be read by musicians
*   With Live coding, you can:
*   Flexible describe rules
*   Hack the code without an UI
*   Interact with your composition, while it is playing
*   Operate on the edge of liveness

### What is Renardo?


*   Renardo is a rebirth of FoxDot, after it has been depreciated. Big thanks to the developer Ryan Kirkbride from Leeds UK for his distribution to the live coding community!
*   Renardo is a Python package that comes with its own IDE and a plugin for [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) called Pulsardo
*   Renardo plays music by accessing any SynthDefs loaded onto a local SuperCollider server with some custom bits of syntax to boot
*   SuperCollider is a programming language originally released in 1996 by James McCartney for real-time audio synthesis and algorithmic compositions, that runs underneath the Renardo environment
*   Live coding with Python via Renardo offers accessible states through its reactive and dynamic objects
*   Renardo focuses on musical patterns, not the digital signal processing (DSP), which is programmed by [SuperCollider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider) and controlled via [OSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control)
*   Renardo has a clean syntax, that is easy to read, so the code can be understood by an audience and traditional musicians without knowing Renardo or Programming
