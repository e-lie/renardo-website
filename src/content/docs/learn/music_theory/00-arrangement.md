### Pop/EDM Arrangement

A typical Pop Arrangement has Intro, Verses, Chorus, Bridge, Refrain, and Outro. There are different radiation of it, but that is the basics.

Common Structures for a song is as followed:

* Intro (4 Bars)
    
* 1.Verse (8 -16 Bars) + Pre-Chorus (Optional)
    
* Chorus (8 - 16 Bars)
    
* 2.Verse (8 - 16 Bars) + Pre-Chorus (Optional)
    
* Chorus (8-16 Bars)
    
* Outro (4 Bars)
    

Bars are 4 beats or beats. So 4 bars in Renardo means 16 counted as beats.

Further structures, whereas A is Verse, B is Chorus, C is Bridge:

**ABABCA** >> Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus
**AABA** >> Verse / Verse / Bridge / Verse
**ABAB** >> Verse / Chorus / Verse / Chorus (simplified version of the ABABCB)
**AAA** >> Verse / Verse / Verse

The following is an example of a song structure in common electronic music:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Intro** | **Break** | **Buildup** | **Drop** | **Break** | **Buildup** | **Drop** | **Outro** |
| 16 Bars | 16 Bars | 4/8/16 Bars | 16 Bars | 16 Bars | 4/8/16 Bars | 16 Bars | 16 Bars |


### Intro

* The Intro is pretty much anything you want it to be.
* Many songs start with just the melody that is rising up. 
* You can even create a melodic question that is answered by the rest of the song or something of the sort. 
* The important thing is to not stay too long at the Intro and make it tie in quickly.
    

### Break/Bridge

* Less loud, less bass heavy, less instruments. 
* This is used to break up what the listener has paid attention to. In electronic music, you usually take out the drums and add a rising sound to the next part.
* A Bridge/Break can be more powerful by adding new instruments or changing the key
* Try to keep this at 8 measures or less.
* The Bridge is a departure from what we’ve heard in a song, previously.
* This goes for both the lyrics and the music. 
* Lyrically it’s an opportunity for a new perspective. 
* Musically, it’s a chance to offer the listener something they haven’t heard before to keep the song interesting.
    

### Buildup

* Goes usually from Break to Drop, can be even silence.
* It creates an emotional tension in the listener, which is then dissolved in the Drop.
    

### Drop

* Loudest, most fun to listen to.
* The moment in a dance track when tension is released and the beat kicks in. This releases an enormous energy during a song's progression.
* After the momentum Buildup, the pitch rising, the tension mounting, bigger, louder, until suddenly — the Drop.
    

### Riser

* A Riser is just like a break except that it is arpeggiate or having some sort of buildup that is released with the next section coming in.
* Usually no beat and last 8 measures or 16.
* When the next part comes in, it will have a lot more energy and should be the climax of the piece.
    

### Outro

* This is used to resolve the song and come in for a smooth landing.
* Some song’s don’t have an Outro and others have a long Outro.
* You can also add a final sense by adding a Coda, or strong cadence at the end of your track.
