 > Disclaimer : Renardo is in the process to propose an integrated, actually simple install process for newcomers. For now it can still be a bumpy road.

## Summary

Renardo is either:
- a **binary application** packaged using **pyinstaller** (_the "easy" install_)
- a **Python library** (actually a set of Python packages) meant to be installed with `pip` (or `pipx`) the Python package manager. (_the manual install_)

To produce sound, Renardo uses **SuperCollider** (a classical, infinitely programmable synth/composition/experimentation environment).
